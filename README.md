Primer
------
Primer is a functional programming language you can learn in an afternoon.

This project contains a reference implementation which can be built with

    make Makefile.reference

as well as the **beginnings** of a second implementation which can be built with

    make

You will need make, gcc, flex, bison and OCaml to compile both sets of code.

To get a feel for Primer, please have a look at the examples directory. Examples can be run as

    ./primer examples/<example>.pri
